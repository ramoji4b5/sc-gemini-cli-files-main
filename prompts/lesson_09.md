# Lesson 9: Gemini CLI for Content Creation

## Use Case

During the conference, videos were recorded but aren't published yet. To promote the video when it launches, you want to create:
- A blog post
- Social media posts
- Video shorts

Using Gemini CLI, the video can remain local to your computer while you generate transcripts and content from it.

## Prompts

### Prompt 1: Generate Transcript
```
Generate a transcript with timestamps from this video @Gemini\ CLI\ Podcast.mp4 and save it into a .txt file.
```

### Prompt 2: Generate Shorts
```
Now, create three MP4 shorts that highlight important parts of the video. Please use the generated transcript to identify the exact start and end timestamps for complete sentences or coherent thoughts. The shorts should be approximately 10-15 seconds long, but prioritize keeping sentences intact over adhering strictly to a specific duration.
```

### Prompt 3: Generate Blog
```
Using only the information from the transcript, generate a blog from the point of view of one of the interviewers. Include images that are related to the content, by taking screenshots from the video and generating images using nano banana. Save the blog as a markdown file.
```

### Prompt 4: Generate Social Media Posts
```
Using only the information from the transcript, generate me four different social media posts to promote the video and the blog. Give me some screenshots and generated images that would match the text of the post. Save the posts in a markdown file.
```

## Other Use Cases

- After generating social media posts, use social media MCPs (X, LinkedIn, BlueSky) to automatically post on different platforms
- Use Gemini CLI to do market research
- Use Nano Banana MCP to generate images
- Use Veo3 to generate videos from images
- Processing a lot of data (e.g., lead scan data)
- Working on pre-launch items where you do not want to upload files anywhere
- Use the Canva extension to make slides or images
