# Conference Organization Suggestions

These are suggestions for organizing a conference based on our experience with organizing the 2025 TechStack Conference.

## 1. Strategy & Pre-Planning
*   **Define Core Objectives:** Do we want to focus on networking, educating, product launches, or community building?
*   **Budgeting:** Create a detailed budget with a 15-20% contingency fund.
Unexpected costs (AV issues, rush printing) will probably arise.
*   **Venue Selection:** We probably need to lock this down almost a year in advance?

## 2. Content & Speakers
*   **Focus on Relevant Topics & Trends**: Attract your audience by focusing on niche trends and emerging technologies. Use social media polls to identify hot topics.
*   **Speaker Selection**: Actively seek thought leaders and speakers from varied backgrounds whose topics align with audience interests, ensuring rich perspectives.
*   **Call for Papers (CFP):** Open this early. And we should have a clear rubric for
grading submissions to avoid bias.
*   **Speaker Prep:** Host a brief "know before you go" call with speakers a week
before. Ensure they know the aspect ratio of the screens (16:9 vs 4:3), where to meet
us, and what to expect.
*   **Engaging Program & Schedule**: Mix keynotes, panels, lightning talks (5-10 min), and workshops to keep energy levels high. Balance presentations with interactive sessions and networking opportunities, ensuring adequate breaks.

## 3. Attendee Experience
*   **Registration:** Do it before the event. QR code scanning is standard. We want
to avoid "swag pickup" at the check-in desk; do that separately to reduce bottlenecks.
*   **Personalization**: Use event management software to offer tailored experiences (e.g., recommend sessions).
*   **Interactive Elements**: Engage attendees with demos, AR showcases, hackathons, or challenges.
*   **Networking**: Provide dedicated spaces and activities for delegates to connect and exchange ideas.
*   **Technology & Wi-Fi**: Secure a dedicated Wi-Fi network for staff/speakers separate from attendees. For virtual/hybrid events, select a reliable platform, train speakers on its use, and have backup streaming options.
*   **Inclusivity:**
    *   Live captioning for talks.
    *   Sign language interpretation for keynotes.
*   **Food & Beverage:** Label *everything* clearly (GF, DF, Vegan, Halal, Kosher)
Water stations should be mixed throughout the venue.

## 4. Logistics & Operations
*   **Signage:** You can't have too much signage. Floor decals are great for navigation.
*   **Power:** Attendees always need to charge devices. Provide power strips
in lounge areas, not just session rooms.
*   **Run of Show:** Have a minute-by-minute schedule for the AV team and
stage managers.

## 5. Marketing & Engagement
*   **Marketing Strategy**: Build a robust marketing strategy tailored to your target audience and their preferred channels. Ensure your website clearly features the schedule and session catalog.
*   **Sponsorship**: Offer tiered sponsorship packages that include branding opportunities and speaking slots.
*   **Social Media:** Create a unique hashtag and promote it early so you can engage with attendees and track socials.

## 6. Post-Event
*   **Feedback & Analysis**: Send a short survey within 24 hours while the experience is fresh. Analyze feedback to make informed decisions for future conferences.
*   **Content:** Upload slides and recordings as fast as possible (ideally within a week).
